## 1. Types

### 1.1 Shared Asset Types

These types are shared between token genesis data and invoice targets — the same representation is used everywhere in the SDK.

```typescript
// =============================================================================
// Shared Asset Types (reused from TXF genesis coinData format)
// =============================================================================

/**
 * A fungible coin entry — same [coinId, amount] tuple used in TxfGenesisData.coinData.
 *
 * Examples: ["UCT", "1000000"], ["USDU", "500000000"], ["ALPHA", "200000"]
 *
 * This is the EXISTING format from TxfGenesisData.coinData: [string, string][].
 * Invoice targets reuse this exact type for consistency.
 */
type CoinEntry = [string, string]; // [coinId, amount in smallest units]

/**
 * An NFT entry — placeholder for future NFT support (not yet implemented in Sphere SDK).
 * Same type will be used in both token genesis and invoice targets when NFTs are added.
 */
interface NFTEntry {
  /** Unique NFT token ID (64-char hex) */
  readonly tokenId: string;
  /** NFT type identifier (64-char hex, optional) */
  readonly tokenType?: string;
}
```

### 1.2 Invoice Types

```typescript
// =============================================================================
// Invoice Types
// =============================================================================

/**
 * A single requested asset in an invoice target.
 * Wraps either a CoinEntry (fungible) or NFTEntry (non-fungible).
 * Exactly one of `coin` or `nft` must be set.
 */
interface InvoiceRequestedAsset {
  /** Fungible token request — same [coinId, amount] tuple as genesis coinData */
  readonly coin?: CoinEntry;
  /** NFT request (placeholder — not yet implemented) */
  readonly nft?: NFTEntry;
}

/**
 * A payment target within an invoice.
 * Each target specifies a destination address and the assets it should receive.
 */
interface InvoiceTarget {
  /** Destination address (DIRECT://... format) */
  readonly address: string;
  /** Requested assets for this address */
  readonly assets: InvoiceRequestedAsset[];

 * This is the complete invoice definition. The token IS the invoice.
 */

  /**
   * Optional ordered list of delivery method URLs, highest priority first.
   *
   * PLACEHOLDER — not used by the current SDK. The SDK currently uses
   * the Nostr-based delivery network exclusively. When delivery method
   * support is implemented, a payer should attempt delivery to the first
   * URL, falling back to subsequent URLs on failure.
   *
   * Examples: ["https://pay.example.com/inv/abc", "wss://relay.example.com"]
   */
  readonly deliveryMethods?: string[];
  /** Payment targets — at least one required */
  readonly targets: InvoiceTarget[];

 * Passed to `accounting.createInvoice()`.
 */

  /** Payment targets — at least one required */
  readonly targets: InvoiceTarget[];
  /** Optional due date (ms timestamp). */
  readonly dueDate?: number;
  /** Optional memo — free text or URL describing the reason for the invoice */
  readonly memo?: string;
  /**
   * Optional ordered list of delivery method URLs, highest priority first.
   * PLACEHOLDER — not used by current SDK (Nostr delivery only).
   */
  readonly deliveryMethods?: string[];
  /**
   * Whether to include the creator's chain pubkey in the invoice terms.
   * Default: true. Set to false to create an anonymous invoice.
   * Anonymous invoices cannot be cancelled.
   */
  readonly anonymous?: boolean;
}
```

### 1.3 Invoice Status Types

```typescript
/**
 * Computed invoice state.
 *
 * For non-terminal states (OPEN, PARTIAL, COVERED, EXPIRED): always derived
 * on-demand from transaction history. Never stored.
 *
 * For terminal states (CLOSED, CANCELLED): balances are frozen and persisted.
 * Dynamic recomputation stops.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Balances are computed from memo-referenced transfers only.
 * Physical token inventory (whether tokens are still held) is irrelevant.
 */

/**
 * Detailed status of a single coin asset within a target.
 *
 * Balance formula:

### 2.2 Memo Parsing Type

```typescript
/**
 * Parsed invoice reference from a transfer memo.
 */
interface InvoiceMemoRef {
  /** Invoice token ID (64-char hex) */
  readonly invoiceId: string;
  /** Payment direction */
  readonly direction: 'forward' | 'back' | 'return_closed' | 'return_cancelled';
  /** Optional free text after the structured prefix */
  readonly freeText?: string;
}
```

### 2.3 Payment Parameter Types

```typescript
/**
 * Parameters for payInvoice().
 */
interface PayInvoiceParams {
  /** Which target to pay (index into invoice terms.targets) */
  readonly targetIndex: number;
  /** Which asset within that target (index into target.assets). Defaults to 0. */
  readonly assetIndex?: number;
  /** Amount to pay (defaults to remaining needed to cover the asset) */
  readonly amount?: string;
  /** Optional free text appended to memo */
  readonly freeText?: string;
}

/**
 * Parameters for returnInvoicePayment().
 */
interface ReturnPaymentParams {
  /** Recipient address (original sender to return tokens to) */
  readonly recipient: string;
  /** Amount to return */
  readonly amount: string;
  /** Coin ID */
  readonly coinId: string;
  /** Optional free text appended to memo */
  readonly freeText?: string;
}
```

### 2.4 Factory Function

```typescript
/**
 * Create an AccountingModule instance.
 * Follows SDK factory pattern (see createPaymentsModule, createMarketModule).
 */
function createAccountingModule(
  config: AccountingModuleConfig,
  deps: AccountingModuleDependencies
): AccountingModule;
```

### 2.5 Barrel Exports (`modules/accounting/index.ts`)

```typescript
export { AccountingModule, createAccountingModule } from './AccountingModule';
export * from './types';
```

---

## 3. Invoice Minting

### 3.1 Token ID Derivation

The invoice token ID is derived deterministically from the invoice content, ensuring that the same invoice parameters always produce the same token ID (enabling idempotent re-minting).

```typescript
// Deterministic token ID from canonical invoice terms
const terms: InvoiceTerms = {
  creator: request.anonymous ? undefined : identity.chainPubkey,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  dueDate: request.dueDate,
  memo: request.memo,
  targets: request.targets,
};
const invoiceBytes = canonicalSerialize(terms);
const tokenId = TokenId.fromData(invoiceBytes);
```

### 3.2 Minting Flow (Mirrors NametagMinter)

```
Step  Action                                SDK Class
----  ------                                ---------
1     Validate CreateInvoiceRequest         AccountingModule
2     Build InvoiceTerms (optionally add    AccountingModule
      creator pubkey, add createdAt)
3     Canonical serialize InvoiceTerms      AccountingModule
4     Generate deterministic salt           SHA-256(signingKey || invoiceBytes)
5     Create MintTransactionData            MintTransactionData.create()
      - tokenType: INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE
      - tokenData: serialized InvoiceTerms
      - coinData: [] (non-fungible)
      - recipient: creator's DirectAddress
6     Create MintCommitment                 MintCommitment.create()
7     Submit to aggregator (3 retries)      client.submitMintCommitment()
      - SUCCESS -> continue
      - REQUEST_ID_EXISTS -> continue (idempotent)
8     Wait for inclusion proof              waitInclusionProof()
9     Create genesis transaction            commitment.toTransaction()
10    Create UnmaskedPredicate + TokenState  UnmaskedPredicate.create()
11    Create Token (with or without          Token.mint() or Token.fromJSON()
      verification based on config)
12    Store token via TokenStorageProvider   tokenStorage.saveToken()
13    Scan full history for pre-existing     AccountingModule
      payments referencing this invoice
14    Fire 'invoice:created' event +        emitEvent()
      retroactive payment/coverage events
```

### 3.3 Invoice Token Type Constant

```typescript
// In constants.ts
/**
 * Token type for invoice tokens (SHA-256 of "unicity.invoice.v1").
 * Distinguishes invoice tokens from currency tokens, nametags, etc.
 */
const INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX =
  bytesToHex(sha256(new TextEncoder().encode('unicity.invoice.v1')));
```

### 3.4 Canonical Serialization

InvoiceTerms must be serialized deterministically (same input -> same bytes) for consistent token ID derivation:

```typescript
function canonicalSerialize(terms: InvoiceTerms): Uint8Array {
  // Sort targets by address (lexicographic)
  // Within each target, sort assets: coins first (sorted by coinId), then NFTs (sorted by tokenId)
  const sorted: Record<string, unknown> = {
    createdAt: terms.createdAt,
    deliveryMethods: terms.deliveryMethods ?? null,
    dueDate: terms.dueDate ?? null,
    memo: terms.memo ?? null,
    targets: [...terms.targets]
      .sort((a, b) => a.address.localeCompare(b.address))
      .map(t => ({
        address: t.address,
        assets: [...t.assets].sort((a, b) => {
          // Coins before NFTs, then sort within category
          if (a.coin && b.coin) return a.coin[0].localeCompare(b.coin[0]);
          if (a.nft && b.nft) return a.nft.tokenId.localeCompare(b.nft.tokenId);
          return a.coin ? -1 : 1; // coins first
        }),
      })),
  };
  // Only include creator if present (anonymous invoices omit it)
  if (terms.creator !== undefined) {
    sorted.creator = terms.creator;
  }
  return new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(sorted));
}
```

## 4. Memo Format

### 4.1 Grammar

```
invoice-memo  = "INV:" invoice-id [ ":" direction ] [ " " free-text ]
invoice-id    = 64HEXDIG
direction     = "F" / "B" / "RC" / "RX"
free-text     = *CHAR
```

### 4.2 Direction Codes

| Code | Constant | Meaning | Balance effect | Auto-returnable | Who can send |
|------|----------|---------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| `F` (or omitted) | `'forward'` | Forward payment towards covering the invoice | +coveredAmount | Yes | Anyone |
| `B` | `'back'` | Manual return/refund | +returnedAmount | **No** | **Target only** |
| `RC` | `'return_closed'` | Auto-return because invoice is closed | +returnedAmount | **No** | **Target only** |
| `RX` | `'return_cancelled'` | Auto-return because invoice is cancelled | +returnedAmount | **No** | **Target only** |

All return directions (`:B`, `:RC`, `:RX`) have the same effect on balance computation — they increase `returnedAmount`. The distinction is semantic.

**Sender restriction:** Only a party whose wallet address matches one of the invoice targets may send return payments (`:B`, `:RC`, `:RX`). Non-target parties can only make forward payments (`:F`). The `returnInvoicePayment()` method and auto-return system enforce this with `INVOICE_NOT_TARGET`.

### 4.3 Regex

```typescript
const INVOICE_MEMO_REGEX = /^INV:([0-9a-fA-F]{64})(?::(F|B|RC|RX))?(?: (.+))?$/;
```

### 4.4 Parsing Implementation

```typescript
function parseInvoiceMemo(memo: string): InvoiceMemoRef | null {
  const match = memo.match(INVOICE_MEMO_REGEX);
  if (!match) return null;

  let direction: InvoiceMemoRef['direction'];
  switch (match[2]) {
    case 'B':  direction = 'back'; break;
    case 'RC': direction = 'return_closed'; break;
    case 'RX': direction = 'return_cancelled'; break;
    default:   direction = 'forward'; break; // F or omitted
  }

  return {
    invoiceId: match[1].toLowerCase(),
    direction,
    freeText: match[3] || undefined,
  };
}
```

### 4.5 Constructing Invoice Memos

```typescript
function buildInvoiceMemo(
  invoiceId: string,
  direction: 'forward' | 'back' | 'return_closed' | 'return_cancelled' = 'forward',
  freeText?: string
): string {
  const dirMap = {
    forward: ':F',
    back: ':B',
    return_closed: ':RC',
    return_cancelled: ':RX',
  };
  const text = freeText ? ` ${freeText}` : '';
  return `INV:${invoiceId}${dirMap[direction]}${text}`;
}
```

### 4.6 Integration with PaymentsModule.send()

No changes to `PaymentsModule.send()` are required. The caller constructs the memo using `buildInvoiceMemo()` and passes it via the existing `TransferRequest.memo` field:

```typescript
await sphere.payments.send({
  recipient: invoiceTarget.address,
  amount: invoiceAsset.coin![1], // amount from CoinEntry tuple
  coinId: invoiceAsset.coin![0], // coinId from CoinEntry tuple
  memo: buildInvoiceMemo(invoiceId, 'forward', 'Order #1234'),
});
```

For auto-return, the accounting module internally calls:

```typescript
await this.deps.payments.send({
  recipient: originalSenderAddress,
  amount: tokenAmount,
  coinId: tokenCoinId,
  memo: buildInvoiceMemo(invoiceId, invoiceIsClosed ? 'return_closed' : 'return_cancelled'),
});
```

---

## 5. Status Computation

### 5.1 Algorithm

```
function computeInvoiceStatus(invoiceId, terms, cancelledSet, closedSet, frozenBalances, history):
  1. Parse terms from token's genesis.data.tokenData

  2. Check terminal states first:
     - if invoiceId in cancelledSet -> return CANCELLED with frozen balances from frozenBalances
     - if invoiceId in closedSet -> return CLOSED with frozen balances from frozenBalances
     - if previously reached implicit CLOSED (all covered + all confirmed)
       -> compute frozen balances, persist, return CLOSED

  3. Scan FULL transaction history (active + sent tokens):
     Filter for entries where parseInvoiceMemo(entry.memo)?.invoiceId === invoiceId

  4. For each matching transfer:
     a. Extract ALL coin entries from the transferred token's coinData.
        A single token may carry multiple coins (multi-asset token).
     b. For EACH coin entry [coinId, amount] in the token:
        i.  Determine target match:
            - For FORWARD payments (F): match target where target.address matches
              the transfer's DESTINATION address
            - For RETURN payments (B, RC, RX): match target where target.address matches
              the transfer's SENDER address (returns flow FROM target TO payer)
        ii. Determine asset match: find coin asset where coinId matches
        iii. If both match -> accumulate into target/asset status
             - forward payment (F): add amount to coveredAmount
             - back/return payment (B, RC, RX): add amount to returnedAmount
        iv.  If address matches but coinId doesn't -> irrelevant (unknown_asset)
        v.   If coinId matches but address doesn't -> irrelevant (unknown_address)
        vi.  If neither matches -> irrelevant (unknown_address_and_asset)
     c. Produce one InvoiceTransferRef per coin entry (same transferId,
        different coinId/amount)

  5. Compute per-coin-asset coverage:
     netCovered = coveredAmount - returnedAmount
     isCovered = netCovered >= requestedAmount (from CoinEntry tuple[1])
     surplus = max(0, netCovered - requestedAmount)

  6. Compute per-target coverage:
     isCovered = all coin assets isCovered AND all NFTs received

  7. Determine state (order matters):
     a. if cancelled -> CANCELLED (terminal, already handled in step 2)
     b. if closed (explicit) -> CLOSED (terminal, already handled in step 2)
     c. if all targets isCovered AND allConfirmed -> CLOSED (implicit terminal)
        -> freeze balances and persist
     d. if all targets isCovered -> COVERED
     e. if any asset has netCovered > 0 -> PARTIAL
     f. if terms.dueDate && now > terms.dueDate -> EXPIRED
     g. else -> OPEN

  8. Note: EXPIRED is checked AFTER CLOSED/COVERED. If all targets are
     covered+confirmed after dueDate, the state is CLOSED, not EXPIRED.

  9. Determine allConfirmed:
     Every InvoiceTransferRef.confirmed === true
```

### 5.2 Balance Computation Details

**The core formula for each target:asset:**

```
coveredAmount  = SUM(amount) for all transfers WHERE:
                 - memo matches INV:<invoiceId>:F (or INV:<invoiceId> without suffix)
                 - destination matches target.address
                 - coinId matches asset.coin[0]

returnedAmount = SUM(amount) for all transfers WHERE:
                 - memo matches INV:<invoiceId>:B or :RC or :RX
                 - sender matches target.address (returns flow FROM target TO payer)
                 - coinId matches asset.coin[0]

netCoveredAmount = coveredAmount - returnedAmount
isCovered        = netCoveredAmount >= asset.coin[1] (requested amount)
surplusAmount    = max(0, netCoveredAmount - asset.coin[1])
```

**Key semantics:**

- **Only memo-referenced transfers count.** A token received without an `INV:` memo does not affect any invoice balance, even if sent to a target address with a matching coin.
- **Spending tokens is independent.** If Alice receives 500 UCT with memo `INV:abc:F`, then spends that 500 UCT on something else (no `INV:abc` memo), the invoice `abc` still shows 500 UCT covered. The spent token's outbound transfer has no invoice memo, so it doesn't affect the invoice.
- **Self-payments affect balance.** If a target address owner sends tokens to themselves with memo `INV:abc:F`, the forward payment increases the covered balance. If they send with `INV:abc:B`, it decreases the balance. This is intentional and valid.
- **Only target parties may return.** Back/return payments (`:B`, `:RC`, `:RX`) can only be sent by a party whose wallet address matches one of the invoice targets. Non-target parties can only make forward payments (`:F`).
- **Terminal state freeze.** Once CLOSED or CANCELLED, balances are frozen and persisted. `getInvoiceStatus()` returns the persisted snapshot. No recomputation occurs. New transfers referencing the invoice are still visible via `getRelatedTransfers()`.
- **Multi-asset tokens.** A single token may carry multiple coin entries (e.g., `coinData = [["UCT", "500"], ["USDU", "1000"]]`). When such a token is transferred with an invoice memo, each coin entry is matched independently against the invoice targets. One transfer of a multi-asset token may cover multiple requested assets for the same target simultaneously.

### 5.3 Multi-Asset Token Handling

When a transfer involves a multi-asset token:

1. Extract all `[coinId, amount]` pairs from the token's `coinData`.
2. For each pair, independently match against the invoice target's address and requested assets.
3. Produce one `InvoiceTransferRef` per coin entry (they share the same `transferId` but have distinct `coinId`/`amount`).
4. Each coin entry may match a different requested asset, or some may be irrelevant.

Example: A token with `coinData = [["UCT", "500"], ["USDU", "1000"]]` transferred to `DIRECT://alice` with memo `INV:abc:F`:
- If the invoice target for alice requests UCT and USDU: both are matched as forward payments.
- If the invoice target for alice only requests UCT: the UCT entry matches, the USDU entry is irrelevant (`unknown_asset`).

### 5.4 History Scanning Scope

The status computation scans the **full transaction history** from `PaymentsModule.getHistory()`. This includes:

- **Inbound transfers** — tokens received by this wallet (active tokens)
- **Outbound transfers** — tokens sent from this wallet (sent/archived tokens)
- Both active and archived (spent) token histories are included

This ensures that all memo-referenced transfers are captured regardless of whether the underlying tokens are still in the inventory.

**Dynamic scanning applies only to non-terminal invoices.** For terminal invoices, the persisted frozen balances are returned directly.

### 5.5 Confirmation Tracking

A transfer is `confirmed` if:
- The token involved has a full proof chain (all `TxfTransaction.inclusionProof` are non-null)
- For outbound transfers: the commitment was included in a unicity certificate
- For inbound transfers: the received token's state transitions are all proven

This is determined by checking `TokenStatus === 'confirmed'` for the related tokens in `PaymentsModule.getTokens()`.

### 5.6 Perspective Handling

The same invoice viewed by different parties:

| Party | Sees inbound transfers as | Sees outbound transfers as |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Recipient (target address owner) | Forward payments covering invoice | Back/return payments (refunds they send) |
| Sender (payer) | Back/return payments they receive | Forward payments they sent |
| Creator (may be either) | Based on their address matching targets | Based on their outbound history |

The status computation uses the wallet's own transaction history, so each party naturally gets their perspective.

### 5.7 EXPIRED State Semantics

EXPIRED is **informational, not terminal**. When `dueDate` has passed:
- If the invoice is already CLOSED -> stays CLOSED (terminal)
- If the invoice is already CANCELLED -> stays CANCELLED (terminal)
- If the invoice is COVERED (all covered but not all confirmed) -> stays COVERED (will transition to CLOSED on confirmation). EXPIRED is NOT reachable from COVERED.
- If the invoice is OPEN or PARTIAL -> becomes EXPIRED
- An EXPIRED invoice can still transition to CLOSED if all targets become covered and confirmed after expiration

This means: due date is a signal to participants, not an enforcement mechanism. The on-chain tokens don't enforce deadlines.

### 5.8 Termination Semantics

**Close and cancel are local operations with persisted frozen balances.**

- **Explicit close (`closeInvoice()`).** The creator/target owner is satisfied with current payments. Balances are frozen at the moment of close. Subsequent forward payments may be auto-returned with `:RC`.
- **Cancel (`cancelInvoice()`).** The creator abandons the deal. Balances are frozen at the moment of cancel. Subsequent forward payments may be auto-returned with `:RX`.
- **Implicit close.** Happens automatically when all targets are fully covered AND all tokens confirmed. Balances are frozen. This is functionally identical to explicit close but with `explicitClose: false` in the status.
- **Outbound blocking.** `payInvoice()` throws `INVOICE_TERMINATED` if the invoice is locally terminated (closed or cancelled). The transfer does NOT happen. This is the only case where the accounting module prevents a transfer.
- **Perspective divergence.** Your CLOSED does not imply others' CLOSED. Different parties have different transaction histories.

### 5.9 Non-Blocking Inbound Guarantee

**Accounting errors MUST NEVER break the inbound token transfer flow.**

Inbound token transfers are atomic — they either happen fully or not at all. The accounting module is a post-hoc observer. All inbound event processing is wrapped in try/catch:

- Memo parsing failure -> transfer proceeds, accounting ignores it
- Invoice lookup failure -> transfer proceeds, `invoice:unknown_reference` fires (best-effort)
- Status computation error -> transfer already complete, event firing skipped
- Auto-return failure -> inbound transfer already recorded, auto-return can be retried
- Storage failure -> transfer data persists in PaymentsModule history, accounting catches up on next recomputation

No exception from the accounting layer may propagate to or interrupt the payment layer for inbound transfers.

**Outbound forward payments to terminated invoices ARE blocked** — `payInvoice()` throws before calling `send()`. This is deliberate: the caller explicitly attempted to pay a terminated invoice.

## 6. Events

### 6.1 Event Definitions

All new events are added to `SphereEventType` union and `SphereEventMap` interface in `types/index.ts`.

```typescript
// New SphereEventType additions:
| 'invoice:created'
| 'invoice:payment'
| 'invoice:asset_covered'
| 'invoice:target_covered'
| 'invoice:covered'
| 'invoice:closed'
| 'invoice:cancelled'
| 'invoice:expired'
| 'invoice:unknown_reference'
| 'invoice:overpayment'
| 'invoice:irrelevant'
| 'invoice:auto_returned'
| 'invoice:return_received'

// New SphereEventMap entries:
'invoice:created': {
  invoiceId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;  // true once mint proof is confirmed
};

'invoice:payment': {
  invoiceId: string;
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
  direction: 'forward' | 'back' | 'return_closed' | 'return_cancelled';
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:asset_covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;     // target address
  coinId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:target_covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;     // target address
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;  // false if any related token is unconfirmed
};

'invoice:closed': {
  invoiceId: string;
  explicit: boolean;   // true if via closeInvoice(), false if implicit (all confirmed)
};

'invoice:cancelled': {
  invoiceId: string;
};

'invoice:expired': {
  invoiceId: string;
  // Informational only -- invoice can still transition to CLOSED
};

'invoice:unknown_reference': {
  invoiceId: string;          // referenced in memo but not in local token storage
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
};

'invoice:overpayment': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;
  coinId: string;
  surplus: string;     // amount exceeding request (smallest units)
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:irrelevant': {
  invoiceId: string;
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
  reason: 'unknown_address' | 'unknown_asset' | 'unknown_address_and_asset';
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:auto_returned': {
  invoiceId: string;
  originalTransfer: InvoiceTransferRef;   // the inbound forward payment that was returned
  returnTransfer: InvoiceTransferRef;     // the outbound return payment
};

'invoice:return_received': {
  invoiceId: string;
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;           // the received :RC or :RX transfer
  returnReason: 'closed' | 'cancelled';   // derived from :RC or :RX
};
```

### 6.2 Event Firing Logic

```
On PaymentsModule 'transfer:incoming' or 'history:updated':
  1. Parse memo -> get invoiceId, direction
  2. If invoiceId not in local token storage:
     -> fire 'invoice:unknown_reference' { invoiceId, transfer }
     -> return
  3. If direction is 'return_closed' or 'return_cancelled':
     -> fire 'invoice:return_received' { invoiceId, transfer, returnReason }
     -> if autoTerminateOnReturn config is true:
        - :RC -> auto-close invoice locally (if not already terminated)
        - :RX -> auto-cancel invoice locally (if not already terminated)
     -> return
  4. If invoice is in terminal state (CLOSED or CANCELLED):
     -> fire 'invoice:payment' (transfer is still recorded)
     -> if direction is 'forward' AND auto-return enabled AND wallet is a target:
        - invoke auto-return: send entire incoming amount back
          (any new forward payment to a terminated invoice is surplus by definition)
        - use :RC for CLOSED, :RX for CANCELLED
        - fire 'invoice:auto_returned'
     -> do not fire balance-related events (frozen)
     -> return
  5. Build InvoiceTransferRef from transfer data
  6. Match transfer against invoice targets:
     a. If matches target + asset:
        -> fire 'invoice:payment' { invoiceId, transfer, direction, confirmed }
     b. If doesn't match any target/asset:
        -> fire 'invoice:irrelevant' { invoiceId, transfer, reason, confirmed }
  7. Recompute status:
     a. If asset just became covered -> fire 'invoice:asset_covered'
     b. If target just became covered -> fire 'invoice:target_covered'
     c. If all targets covered:
        - If all confirmed -> fire 'invoice:closed' { explicit: false }
          -> freeze balances and persist
        - Else -> fire 'invoice:covered' { confirmed: false }
     d. If surplus detected -> fire 'invoice:overpayment'
     e. If terms.dueDate && now > terms.dueDate && state is OPEN or PARTIAL:
        -> fire 'invoice:expired' { invoiceId }

On PaymentsModule 'transfer:confirmed':
  1. Check if transfer has invoice memo reference
  2. If invoice is in terminal state -> skip
  3. If yes, recompute and re-fire all applicable events with confirmed: true
  4. If all targets covered AND now all confirmed -> fire 'invoice:closed' { explicit: false }
     -> freeze balances and persist

On createInvoice() or importInvoice():
  1. Store the invoice token
  2. Scan FULL transaction history for transfers referencing this invoice
  3. For each matching transfer found: fire events as if the transfer just arrived
     (invoice:payment, invoice:asset_covered, invoice:target_covered, etc.)
  4. This handles the P2P async case where payments arrive before the invoice
```

### 6.3 Idempotency Contract

**Events may fire multiple times.** The AccountingModule does NOT track which events have been fired. On every relevant trigger (incoming transfer, confirmation, history update, invoice creation/import with retroactive scan), it recomputes from scratch and fires all applicable events.

This means consumers WILL receive duplicate events and MUST handle them idempotently:
- A UI should update its display, not append to a list
- A notification system should deduplicate by (invoiceId, event type, transferId)
- A logging system can safely log duplicates

This design is intentional -- it avoids complex "already-fired" bookkeeping and aligns with the Nostr re-delivery model used elsewhere in the SDK.

### 6.4 Due Date Expiration

The `invoice:expired` event fires when `getInvoiceStatus()` or event recomputation detects that `dueDate` has passed and the invoice is in OPEN or PARTIAL state. Since events are idempotent, this may fire multiple times. Consumers should treat it as informational.

---

## 7. Storage

### 7.1 Token Storage (Primary)

Invoice tokens are stored via `TokenStorageProvider` -- the **same** provider used for currency tokens, nametag tokens, etc. The token's `genesis.data.tokenType` of `INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX` identifies it as an invoice.

On `load()`, the AccountingModule filters all tokens in storage by token type to discover invoice tokens. All invoice data (terms, creator, targets, etc.) is read from the token's `genesis.data.tokenData` field.

### 7.2 Termination Storage

Since termination (close/cancel) is local-only (not encoded in the token), per-address keys track terminated invoice IDs and their frozen balances:

Added to `STORAGE_KEYS_ADDRESS` in `constants.ts`:

```typescript
/** Cancelled invoice IDs (JSON string array) */
CANCELLED_INVOICES: 'cancelled_invoices',
/** Explicitly closed invoice IDs (JSON string array) */
CLOSED_INVOICES: 'closed_invoices',
/** Frozen balance snapshots for terminated invoices (JSON map: invoiceId -> FrozenInvoiceBalances) */
FROZEN_BALANCES: 'frozen_balances',
/** Auto-return settings (JSON: AutoReturnSettings) */
AUTO_RETURN: 'auto_return',
```

Full key format: `sphere_{addressId}_cancelled_invoices`, etc.

### 7.3 Frozen Balance Schema

```typescript
/**
 * Persisted frozen balance snapshot for a terminated invoice.
 * Stored when an invoice transitions to CLOSED or CANCELLED.
 */
interface FrozenInvoiceBalances {
  /** Terminal state at time of freezing */
  readonly state: 'CLOSED' | 'CANCELLED';
  /** Whether this was an explicit close (true) or implicit (false). Only for CLOSED. */
  readonly explicitClose?: boolean;
  /** Timestamp when balances were frozen */
  readonly frozenAt: number;
  /** Per-target, per-asset balance snapshot */
  readonly targets: FrozenTargetBalances[];
  /** Total forward payments across all targets, keyed by coinId */
  readonly totalForward: Record<string, string>;
  /** Total back/return payments across all targets, keyed by coinId */
  readonly totalBack: Record<string, string>;
  /** Whether all related tokens were confirmed at freeze time */
  readonly allConfirmed: boolean;
}

interface FrozenTargetBalances {
  readonly address: string;
  readonly coinAssets: FrozenCoinAssetBalances[];
}

interface FrozenCoinAssetBalances {
  readonly coin: CoinEntry;
  readonly coveredAmount: string;
  readonly returnedAmount: string;
  readonly netCoveredAmount: string;
  readonly isCovered: boolean;
  readonly surplusAmount: string;
}

// Storage format: Record<string, FrozenInvoiceBalances>
// Key: invoiceId, Value: FrozenInvoiceBalances
type FrozenBalancesStorage = Record<string, FrozenInvoiceBalances>;
```

### 7.4 Auto-Return Storage Schema

```typescript
// Stored under AUTO_RETURN key
interface AutoReturnStorage {
  /** Global auto-return for all terminated invoices */
  global: boolean;
  /** Per-invoice overrides: invoiceId -> enabled */
  perInvoice: Record<string, boolean>;
}
```

### 7.5 Storage Operations

```
createInvoice():
  1. tokenStorage.saveToken(invoiceToken)       // TXF token with InvoiceTerms in tokenData
  2. Scan full history for pre-existing payments // retroactive evaluation
  3. If immediately reaches CLOSED (all covered + all confirmed):
     -> freeze balances and persist to FROZEN_BALANCES
  4. Fire events                                 // created + any retroactive events

importInvoice():
  1. tokenStorage.saveToken(invoiceToken)       // same as any received token
  2. Scan full history for pre-existing payments // retroactive evaluation
  3. If immediately reaches CLOSED:
     -> freeze balances and persist
  4. Fire events                                 // any retroactive events

closeInvoice():
  1. Compute current balances one final time
  2. Persist frozen balances to FROZEN_BALANCES storage
  3. Add invoiceId to CLOSED_INVOICES set in storage
  4. If options.autoReturn:
     -> enable auto-return for this invoice
     -> immediately return SURPLUS ONLY (per target:asset, amount exceeding requested)
     -> use :RC memo direction
  5. Fire 'invoice:closed' { explicit: true }
  6. Fire 'invoice:auto_returned' for each surplus return (if any)

cancelInvoice():
  1. Load cancelled set from storage
  2. Compute current balances one final time
  3. Persist frozen balances to FROZEN_BALANCES storage
  4. Add invoiceId to CANCELLED_INVOICES set in storage
  5. If options.autoReturn:
     -> enable auto-return for this invoice
     -> immediately return EVERYTHING (all forward payments received)
     -> use :RX memo direction
  6. Fire 'invoice:cancelled'
  7. Fire 'invoice:auto_returned' for each return (if any)

getInvoiceStatus():
  1. Read token from tokenStorage (parse terms from genesis.data.tokenData)
  2. Check cancelled set and closed set
  3. If terminal -> load frozen balances from FROZEN_BALANCES, return frozen status
  4. Read full history from PaymentsModule (active + sent tokens)
  5. Compute status (pure function)
  6. If just reached implicit CLOSED -> freeze and persist

setAutoReturn():
  1. Load AUTO_RETURN from storage
  2. Update global flag or per-invoice entry
  3. Persist to storage
  4. If enabling (enabled=true), trigger immediate auto-return for applicable invoices:
     - For specific invoiceId: if terminated AND wallet is a target:
       - CLOSED -> return surplus only (per target:asset)
       - CANCELLED -> return everything
     - For '*': iterate all terminated invoices where wallet is a target:
       - CLOSED -> return surplus only
       - CANCELLED -> return everything
  5. Fire 'invoice:auto_returned' for each return executed

load():
  1. Enumerate tokens from tokenStorage
  2. Filter by tokenType === INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX
  3. Parse InvoiceTerms from each token's genesis.data.tokenData
  4. Load cancelled set, closed set, frozen balances, and auto-return settings from storage
  5. Subscribe to PaymentsModule events
  6. Scan full history for pre-existing payments -> fire retroactive events
```

## 8. Validation Rules

### 8.1 CreateInvoiceRequest Validation

| Rule | Error |
|------|-------|

|------|---------|------|
| `INVOICE_NO_TARGETS` | Invoice must have at least one target | Empty targets array |
| `INVOICE_INVALID_ADDRESS` | Invalid target address: must be DIRECT:// format | Bad address format |
| `INVOICE_NO_ASSETS` | Target must have at least one asset | Empty assets in target |
| `INVOICE_INVALID_ASSET` | Asset must have exactly one of coin or nft | Both or neither set |
| `INVOICE_INVALID_AMOUNT` | Coin amount must be a positive integer string | Non-positive or non-integer |

| `INVOICE_DUPLICATE_NFT` | Duplicate NFT tokenId in target | Same NFT in one target |
| `INVOICE_MINT_FAILED` | Failed to mint invoice token: {details} | Aggregator failure |
| `INVOICE_INVALID_PROOF` | Invoice token has invalid inclusion proof | Import validation |
| `INVOICE_WRONG_TOKEN_TYPE` | Token is not an invoice token | Wrong tokenType on import |
| `INVOICE_INVALID_DATA` | Cannot parse invoice terms from token data | Corrupt tokenData |
| `INVOICE_ALREADY_EXISTS` | Invoice token already exists locally | Duplicate import |
| `INVOICE_NOT_FOUND` | Invoice token not found | Unknown invoiceId |
| `INVOICE_ANONYMOUS` | Anonymous invoices cannot be cancelled | Cancel on anonymous |
| `INVOICE_NOT_CREATOR` | Only the creator can cancel an invoice | Cancel by non-creator |
| `INVOICE_NOT_AUTHORIZED` | Only the creator or a target owner can close an invoice | Close by unauthorized party |
| `INVOICE_ALREADY_CLOSED` | Invoice is already closed | Close/cancel after CLOSED |
| `INVOICE_ALREADY_CANCELLED` | Invoice is already cancelled | Close/cancel after CANCELLED |
| `INVOICE_ORACLE_REQUIRED` | Oracle provider required for invoice minting | No oracle configured |

**IMPORTANT:** All error codes above apply to the accounting module's own operations. Accounting errors during inbound transfer event processing are caught internally and logged — they NEVER propagate to or interrupt the inbound token transfer flow. The one exception is `INVOICE_TERMINATED` for outbound forward payments, which is thrown intentionally to prevent paying a terminated invoice.

## Appendix C: Exchange/Swap Scenario

```
Exchange creates invoice:
  Target 1: exchange_address <- Buyer sends 100 USDU  [coin: ["USDU", "100000000"]]
  Target 2: buyer_address    <- Exchange sends 50 TKN  [coin: ["TKN", "50000000"]]

Both parties hold the invoice token.

Buyer sends 100 USDU -> memo: INV:xxx:F
  -> Exchange sees: target[0] COVERED (from their inbound history)
  -> Buyer sees: target[0] payment sent (from their outbound history)

Exchange sends 50 TKN -> memo: INV:xxx:F
  -> Buyer sees: target[1] COVERED (from their inbound history)
  -> Exchange sees: target[1] payment sent (from their outbound history)

Both parties independently compute COVERED -> CLOSED (implicit).
Balances frozen and persisted after CLOSED.
```

## Appendix D: P2P Async -- Payment Before Invoice

```
Time 1: Payer sends 500 USDU with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Recipient receives transfer
        -> AccountingModule fires invoice:unknown_reference (abc not yet known)
        -> Transfer recorded in history

Time 2: Recipient creates/imports invoice token abc
        -> AccountingModule performs full history rescan
        -> Finds the Time 1 transfer with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Fires invoice:payment for 500 USDU (retroactive)
        -> If 500 USDU covers the target:asset, fires invoice:asset_covered
        -> Continues with normal event cascade

This works because all events are idempotent.
```

## Appendix E: Token Spending Independence

```
Time 1: Alice receives 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 500

Time 2: Alice spends the 500 UCT token to buy something (memo: "Coffee")
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 500 (UNCHANGED)
        -> The outbound transfer has no INV:abc memo, so it doesn't affect the invoice
        -> The 500 UCT token is archived, but its INBOUND history entry still exists

Time 3: Alice receives another 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 1000

Time 4: Alice sends 200 UCT back with memo INV:abc:B
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 1000, returned = 200, net = 800
```

## Appendix F: Multi-Asset Token Transfer

```
Invoice abc:
  Target: DIRECT://alice
    - coin: ["UCT", "1000"]
    - coin: ["USDU", "500"]

Time 1: Payer sends a MULTI-ASSET token with
        coinData = [["UCT", "600"], ["USDU", "500"]]
        memo: INV:abc:F
        destination: DIRECT://alice

        -> AccountingModule extracts both coin entries:
           - InvoiceTransferRef { transferId: "tx1", coinId: "UCT", amount: "600" }
           - InvoiceTransferRef { transferId: "tx1", coinId: "USDU", amount: "500" }
        -> UCT: coveredAmount = 600, net = 600 (needs 1000 -- not yet covered)
        -> USDU: coveredAmount = 500, net = 500 (needs 500 -- COVERED)
        -> Fires: invoice:payment (x2, one per coin)
        -> Fires: invoice:asset_covered for USDU
        -> State: PARTIAL (UCT still uncovered)

Time 2: Payer sends another token with coinData = [["UCT", "400"]]
        memo: INV:abc:F
        -> UCT: coveredAmount = 1000, net = 1000 -- COVERED
        -> Fires: invoice:asset_covered for UCT
        -> Fires: invoice:target_covered for alice
        -> Fires: invoice:covered
        -> ... all confirmed -> invoice:closed { explicit: false }
        -> Balances frozen and persisted
```

## Appendix G: Termination and Auto-Return

```
--- Explicit Close with Auto-Return (surplus only) ---

Invoice abc requests 1000 UCT from DIRECT://alice.
Alice has received 1200 UCT via INV:abc:F (200 surplus).

Alice closes invoice (satisfied with payments):
  -> closeInvoice('abc', { autoReturn: true })
  -> Balances frozen: covered=1200, net=1200, surplus=200
  -> Auto-return enabled -> IMMEDIATELY returns 200 UCT surplus
     with memo INV:abc:RC (return-for-closed)
  -> Fires invoice:closed { explicit: true }
  -> Fires invoice:auto_returned (for the 200 surplus)
  NOTE: Only the surplus (200) is returned, not the full 1200.

Later, sender sends 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F (unaware of closure):
  -> Token transfer succeeds (inbound transfers are NEVER blocked)
  -> Auto-return enabled -> entire 500 UCT returned with INV:abc:RC
     (any new forward payment to a CLOSED invoice is surplus by definition)
  -> Fires invoice:auto_returned

Sender receives the auto-return (INV:abc:RC):
  -> Fires invoice:return_received { returnReason: 'closed' }
  -> If autoTerminateOnReturn is true:
     -> Sender's module auto-closes invoice abc locally

--- Cancellation with Auto-Return (everything) ---

Invoice abc requests 1000 UCT from DIRECT://alice.
Alice has received 600 UCT via INV:abc:F (no surplus, partially covered).

Alice cancels invoice (abandoning the deal):
  -> cancelInvoice('abc', { autoReturn: true })
  -> Balances frozen: covered=600, net=600
  -> Auto-return enabled -> IMMEDIATELY returns ALL 600 UCT
     with memo INV:abc:RX (return-for-cancelled)
  -> Fires invoice:cancelled
  -> Fires invoice:auto_returned (for the full 600)
  NOTE: Everything is returned, not just surplus.

Later, sender sends 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F (unaware of cancellation):
  -> Token transfer succeeds (inbound NEVER blocked)
  -> Auto-return -> entire 500 UCT back with memo INV:abc:RX
  -> Fires invoice:auto_returned

Sender receives the auto-return (INV:abc:RX):
  -> Fires invoice:return_received { returnReason: 'cancelled' }
  -> Sender's module MAY auto-cancel invoice abc locally

--- Manual Return (Always Allowed, Target Only) ---

At any time, an invoice TARGET can return tokens:
  -> returnInvoicePayment('abc', { recipient, amount, coinId })
  -> Sends with memo INV:abc:B
  -> This is independent of auto-return settings
  -> Works for both terminated and non-terminated invoices
  -> NON-TARGET parties CANNOT return (throws INVOICE_NOT_TARGET)

--- Outbound Forward Payment Blocking ---

After sender's invoice abc is locally CLOSED or CANCELLED:
  -> payInvoice('abc', ...) -> throws INVOICE_TERMINATED
  -> The token transfer does NOT happen
  -> Caller must handle the error (show UI message, etc.)

--- Enabling Auto-Return After Termination ---

If auto-return was NOT enabled at termination time, it can be enabled later:
  -> setAutoReturn('abc', true)
  -> Triggers immediate auto-return for invoice abc:
     - If CLOSED: returns surplus only
     - If CANCELLED: returns everything
  -> Also enables ongoing auto-return for future incoming payments

Global enable:
  -> setAutoReturn('*', true)
  -> Triggers immediate auto-return for ALL terminated invoices
     where wallet is a target
  -> Also enables ongoing auto-return for all future terminated invoices
```

## Appendix H: Auto-Return Loop Prevention

```
Auto-return is specifically designed to prevent infinite loops:

1. Only FORWARD payments (:F) are auto-returned.
2. Return payments (:B, :RC, :RX) are NEVER auto-returned.

Example:
  Alice closes invoice, enables auto-return.
  Bob sends 500 UCT with INV:abc:F -> Alice auto-returns with INV:abc:RC
  Bob receives INV:abc:RC -> this is a RETURN, not auto-returned
  -> No loop. Bob sees the return and knows the invoice is closed.

Even if Bob has auto-return enabled on his side:
  Bob's auto-return only triggers on incoming :F payments.
  The :RC payment Bob receives is NOT :F, so it is NOT auto-returned.
  -> Still no loop.
```

## Appendix I: Target-Only Return Restriction

```
Invoice abc:
  Target: DIRECT://alice (requests 1000 UCT)

Bob (payer, NOT a target):
  -> payInvoice('abc', ...) with INV:abc:F -> OK (anyone can make forward payments)
  -> returnInvoicePayment('abc', ...) -> throws INVOICE_NOT_TARGET
     (Bob's address doesn't match any invoice target)

Alice (target):
  -> returnInvoicePayment('abc', ...) with INV:abc:B -> OK (alice IS a target)
  -> Auto-return also works for Alice (she is a target)

This restriction ensures that only the party who received tokens for an
invoice can return them. Non-targets have no tokens to return and no
authority to affect the invoice balance via return payments.
```
