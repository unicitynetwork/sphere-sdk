## 1. Types

### 1.1 Shared Asset Types

These types are shared between token genesis data and invoice targets — the same representation is used everywhere in the SDK.

```typescript
// =============================================================================
// Shared Asset Types (reused from TXF genesis coinData format)
// =============================================================================

/**
 * A fungible coin entry — same [coinId, amount] tuple used in TxfGenesisData.coinData.
 *
 * Examples: ["UCT", "1000000"], ["USDU", "500000000"], ["ALPHA", "200000"]
 *
 * This is the EXISTING format from TxfGenesisData.coinData: [string, string][].
 * Invoice targets reuse this exact type for consistency.
 */
type CoinEntry = [string, string]; // [coinId, amount in smallest units]

/**
 * An NFT entry — placeholder for future NFT support (not yet implemented in Sphere SDK).
 * Same type will be used in both token genesis and invoice targets when NFTs are added.
 */
interface NFTEntry {
  /** Unique NFT token ID (64-char hex) */
  readonly tokenId: string;
  /** NFT type identifier (64-char hex, optional) */
  readonly tokenType?: string;
}
```

### 1.2 Invoice Types

```typescript
// =============================================================================
// Invoice Types
// =============================================================================

/**
 * A single requested asset in an invoice target.
 * Wraps either a CoinEntry (fungible) or NFTEntry (non-fungible).
 * Exactly one of `coin` or `nft` must be set.
 */
interface InvoiceRequestedAsset {
  /** Fungible token request — same [coinId, amount] tuple as genesis coinData */
  readonly coin?: CoinEntry;
  /** NFT request (placeholder — not yet implemented) */
  readonly nft?: NFTEntry;
}

/**
 * A payment target within an invoice.
 * Each target specifies a destination address and the assets it should receive.
 */
interface InvoiceTarget {
  /** Destination address (DIRECT://... format) */
  readonly address: string;
  /** Requested assets for this address */
  readonly assets: InvoiceRequestedAsset[];
}

/**
 * Invoice terms — the payload serialized into the token's genesis.data.tokenData field.
 * This is the complete invoice definition. The token IS the invoice.
 */

   * Chain pubkey of the invoice creator.
   * OPTIONAL — when omitted, the invoice is anonymous.
   * Anonymous invoices cannot be cancelled (no creator to verify).

  /**
   * Optional ordered list of delivery method URLs, highest priority first.
   *
   * PLACEHOLDER — not used by the current SDK. The SDK currently uses
   * the Nostr-based delivery network exclusively. When delivery method
   * support is implemented, a payer should attempt delivery to the first
   * URL, falling back to subsequent URLs on failure.
   *
   * Examples: ["https://pay.example.com/inv/abc", "wss://relay.example.com"]
   */
  readonly deliveryMethods?: string[];
  /** Payment targets — at least one required */
  readonly targets: InvoiceTarget[];

  /** Payment targets — at least one required */
  readonly targets: InvoiceTarget[];
  /** Optional due date (ms timestamp). */
  readonly dueDate?: number;
  /** Optional memo — free text or URL describing the reason for the invoice */
  readonly memo?: string;
  /**
   * Optional ordered list of delivery method URLs, highest priority first.
   * PLACEHOLDER — not used by current SDK (Nostr delivery only).
   */
  readonly deliveryMethods?: string[];

   * Whether to include the creator's chain pubkey in the invoice terms.
   * Default: true. Set to false to create an anonymous invoice.
   * Anonymous invoices cannot be cancelled.
   */
  readonly anonymous?: boolean;

```

### 1.3 Invoice Status Types

```typescript
/**
 * Computed invoice state.
 * NEVER stored — always derived on-demand from transaction history.

## 2. Module API

### 2.1 AccountingModule Class

```typescript
class AccountingModule {
  constructor(config: AccountingModuleConfig, deps: AccountingModuleDependencies);

  /**
   * Load invoice tokens from TokenStorageProvider.
   * Called by Sphere after module construction.
   *
   * Steps:
   * 1. Enumerate tokens, filter by INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX
   * 2. Parse InvoiceTerms from each token's genesis.data.tokenData
   * 3. Load cancelled set from storage
   * 4. Subscribe to PaymentsModule events
   * 5. Scan full transaction history for any pre-existing payments
   *    referencing known invoices, and fire retroactive events

   * 5. Store token via TokenStorageProvider
   * 6. Scan full transaction history for pre-existing payments referencing
   *    this invoice (handles P2P async: payment arrives before invoice)

```

### 2.2 Memo Parsing Type

```typescript
/**
 * Parsed invoice reference from a transfer memo.
 */
interface InvoiceMemoRef {
  /** Invoice token ID (64-char hex) */
  readonly invoiceId: string;
  /** Payment direction */
  readonly direction: 'forward' | 'back';
  /** Optional free text after the structured prefix */
  readonly freeText?: string;
}
```

### 2.3 Factory Function

```typescript
/**
 * Create an AccountingModule instance.
 * Follows SDK factory pattern (see createPaymentsModule, createMarketModule).
 */
function createAccountingModule(
  config: AccountingModuleConfig,
  deps: AccountingModuleDependencies
): AccountingModule;
```

### 2.4 Barrel Exports (`modules/accounting/index.ts`)

```typescript
export { AccountingModule, createAccountingModule } from './AccountingModule';
export * from './types';
```

---

## 3. Invoice Minting

### 3.1 Token ID Derivation

The invoice token ID is derived deterministically from the invoice content, ensuring that the same invoice parameters always produce the same token ID (enabling idempotent re-minting).

```typescript
// Deterministic token ID from canonical invoice terms
const terms: InvoiceTerms = {
  creator: request.anonymous ? undefined : identity.chainPubkey,
  createdAt: Date.now(),
  dueDate: request.dueDate,
  memo: request.memo,
  targets: request.targets,
};
const invoiceBytes = canonicalSerialize(terms);
const tokenId = TokenId.fromData(invoiceBytes);
```

### 3.2 Minting Flow (Mirrors NametagMinter)

```
Step  Action                                SDK Class
----  ------                                ---------
1     Validate CreateInvoiceRequest         AccountingModule
2     Build InvoiceTerms (optionally add    AccountingModule
      creator pubkey, add createdAt)
3     Canonical serialize InvoiceTerms      AccountingModule
4     Generate deterministic salt           SHA-256(signingKey || invoiceBytes)
5     Create MintTransactionData            MintTransactionData.create()
      - tokenType: INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE
      - tokenData: serialized InvoiceTerms
      - coinData: [] (non-fungible)
      - recipient: creator's DirectAddress
6     Create MintCommitment                 MintCommitment.create()
7     Submit to aggregator (3 retries)      client.submitMintCommitment()
      - SUCCESS -> continue
      - REQUEST_ID_EXISTS -> continue (idempotent)
8     Wait for inclusion proof              waitInclusionProof()
9     Create genesis transaction            commitment.toTransaction()
10    Create UnmaskedPredicate + TokenState  UnmaskedPredicate.create()
11    Create Token (with or without          Token.mint() or Token.fromJSON()
      verification based on config)
12    Store token via TokenStorageProvider   tokenStorage.saveToken()
13    Scan full history for pre-existing     AccountingModule
      payments referencing this invoice
14    Fire 'invoice:created' event +        emitEvent()
      retroactive payment/coverage events
```

### 3.3 Invoice Token Type Constant

```typescript
// In constants.ts
/**
 * Token type for invoice tokens (SHA-256 of "unicity.invoice.v1").
 * Distinguishes invoice tokens from currency tokens, nametags, etc.
 */
const INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX =
  sha256(new TextEncoder().encode('unicity.invoice.v1')).toString('hex');
```

### 3.4 Canonical Serialization

InvoiceTerms must be serialized deterministically (same input -> same bytes) for consistent token ID derivation:

```typescript
function canonicalSerialize(terms: InvoiceTerms): Uint8Array {
  // Sort targets by address (lexicographic)
  // Within each target, sort assets: coins first (sorted by coinId), then NFTs (sorted by tokenId)
  const sorted: Record<string, unknown> = {
    createdAt: terms.createdAt,
    deliveryMethods: terms.deliveryMethods ?? null,
    dueDate: terms.dueDate ?? null,
    memo: terms.memo ?? null,
    targets: [...terms.targets]
      .sort((a, b) => a.address.localeCompare(b.address))
      .map(t => ({
        address: t.address,
        assets: [...t.assets].sort((a, b) => {
          // Coins before NFTs, then sort within category
          if (a.coin && b.coin) return a.coin[0].localeCompare(b.coin[0]);
          if (a.nft && b.nft) return a.nft.tokenId.localeCompare(b.nft.tokenId);
          return a.coin ? -1 : 1; // coins first
        }),
      })),
  };
  // Only include creator if present (anonymous invoices omit it)
  if (terms.creator !== undefined) {
    sorted.creator = terms.creator;
  }
  return new TextEncoder().encode(JSON.stringify(sorted));
}
```

---

## 4. Memo Format

### 4.1 Grammar

```
invoice-memo  = "INV:" invoice-id [ ":" direction ] [ " " free-text ]
invoice-id    = 64HEXDIG
direction     = "F" / "B"
free-text     = *CHAR
```

### 4.2 Regex

```typescript
const INVOICE_MEMO_REGEX = /^INV:([0-9a-fA-F]{64})(?::(F|B))?(?: (.+))?$/;
```

### 4.3 Parsing Implementation

```typescript
function parseInvoiceMemo(memo: string): InvoiceMemoRef | null {
  const match = memo.match(INVOICE_MEMO_REGEX);
  if (!match) return null;
  return {
    invoiceId: match[1].toLowerCase(),
    direction: match[2] === 'B' ? 'back' : 'forward',
    freeText: match[3] || undefined,
  };
}
```

### 4.4 Constructing Invoice Memos

```typescript
function buildInvoiceMemo(
  invoiceId: string,
  direction: 'forward' | 'back' = 'forward',
  freeText?: string
): string {
  const dir = direction === 'back' ? ':B' : ':F';
  const text = freeText ? ` ${freeText}` : '';
  return `INV:${invoiceId}${dir}${text}`;
}
```

### 4.5 Integration with PaymentsModule.send()

No changes to `PaymentsModule.send()` are required. The caller constructs the memo using `buildInvoiceMemo()` and passes it via the existing `TransferRequest.memo` field:

```typescript
await sphere.payments.send({
  recipient: invoiceTarget.address,
  amount: invoiceAsset.coin![1], // amount from CoinEntry tuple
  coinId: invoiceAsset.coin![0], // coinId from CoinEntry tuple
  memo: buildInvoiceMemo(invoiceId, 'forward', 'Order #1234'),
});
```

---

## 5. Status Computation

### 5.1 Algorithm

```
function computeInvoiceStatus(invoiceId, terms, cancelledSet, history):
  1. Parse terms from token's genesis.data.tokenData

  2. Check terminal states first:
     - if invoiceId in cancelledSet -> return CANCELLED with frozen balances
     - if previously computed as CLOSED (all covered + all confirmed)
       -> return CLOSED with frozen balances

  3. Scan FULL transaction history (active + sent tokens):
     Filter for entries where parseInvoiceMemo(entry.memo)?.invoiceId === invoiceId

  4. For each matching transfer:
     a. Extract ALL coin entries from the transferred token's coinData.
        A single token may carry multiple coins (multi-asset token).
     b. For EACH coin entry [coinId, amount] in the token:
        i.  Determine target match: find target where target.address matches
            the transfer's destination address
        ii. Determine asset match: find coin asset where coinId matches
        iii. If both match -> accumulate into target/asset status
             - forward payment: add amount to coveredAmount
             - back payment: add amount to returnedAmount
        iv.  If address matches but coinId doesn't -> irrelevant (unknown_asset)
        v.   If coinId matches but address doesn't -> irrelevant (unknown_address)
        vi.  If neither matches -> irrelevant (unknown_address_and_asset)
     c. Produce one InvoiceTransferRef per coin entry (same transferId,
        different coinId/amount)

  5. Compute per-coin-asset coverage:
     netCovered = coveredAmount - returnedAmount
     isCovered = netCovered >= requestedAmount (from CoinEntry tuple[1])
     surplus = max(0, netCovered - requestedAmount)

  6. Compute per-target coverage:
     isCovered = all coin assets isCovered AND all NFTs received

  7. Determine state (order matters):
     a. if cancelled -> CANCELLED (terminal, already handled in step 2)
     b. if all targets isCovered AND allConfirmed -> CLOSED (terminal)
     c. if all targets isCovered -> COVERED
     d. if any asset has netCovered > 0 -> PARTIAL
     e. if terms.dueDate && now > terms.dueDate -> EXPIRED
     f. else -> OPEN

  8. Note: EXPIRED is checked AFTER CLOSED/COVERED. If all targets are
     covered+confirmed after dueDate, the state is CLOSED, not EXPIRED.

  9. Determine allConfirmed:
     Every InvoiceTransferRef.confirmed === true
```

### 5.2 Balance Computation Details

**The core formula for each target:asset:**

```
coveredAmount  = SUM(amount) for all transfers WHERE:
                 - memo matches INV:<invoiceId>:F (or INV:<invoiceId> without suffix)
                 - destination matches target.address
                 - coinId matches asset.coin[0]

returnedAmount = SUM(amount) for all transfers WHERE:
                 - memo matches INV:<invoiceId>:B
                 - destination matches target.address
                 - coinId matches asset.coin[0]

netCoveredAmount = coveredAmount - returnedAmount
isCovered        = netCoveredAmount >= asset.coin[1] (requested amount)
surplusAmount    = max(0, netCoveredAmount - asset.coin[1])
```

**Key semantics:**

- **Only memo-referenced transfers count.** A token received without an `INV:` memo does not affect any invoice balance, even if sent to a target address with a matching coin.
- **Spending tokens is independent.** If Alice receives 500 UCT with memo `INV:abc:F`, then spends that 500 UCT on something else (no `INV:abc` memo), the invoice `abc` still shows 500 UCT covered. The spent token's outbound transfer has no invoice memo, so it doesn't affect the invoice.
- **Self-payments affect balance.** If a target address owner sends tokens to themselves with memo `INV:abc:F`, the forward payment increases the covered balance. If they send with `INV:abc:B`, it decreases the balance. This is intentional and valid.
- **Terminal state freeze.** Once CLOSED or CANCELLED, `getInvoiceStatus()` returns the frozen state. New transfers referencing the invoice are still visible via `getRelatedTransfers()` but do not change the status or balances.
- **Multi-asset tokens.** A single token may carry multiple coin entries (e.g., `coinData = [["UCT", "500"], ["USDU", "1000"]]`). When such a token is transferred with an invoice memo, each coin entry is matched independently against the invoice targets. One transfer of a multi-asset token may cover multiple requested assets for the same target simultaneously.

### 5.3 Multi-Asset Token Handling

When a transfer involves a multi-asset token:

1. Extract all `[coinId, amount]` pairs from the token's `coinData`.
2. For each pair, independently match against the invoice target's address and requested assets.
3. Produce one `InvoiceTransferRef` per coin entry (they share the same `transferId` but have distinct `coinId`/`amount`).
4. Each coin entry may match a different requested asset, or some may be irrelevant.

Example: A token with `coinData = [["UCT", "500"], ["USDU", "1000"]]` transferred to `DIRECT://alice` with memo `INV:abc:F`:
- If the invoice target for alice requests UCT and USDU: both are matched as forward payments.
- If the invoice target for alice only requests UCT: the UCT entry matches, the USDU entry is irrelevant (`unknown_asset`).

### 5.4 History Scanning Scope

The status computation scans the **full transaction history** from `PaymentsModule.getHistory()`. This includes:

- **Inbound transfers** — tokens received by this wallet (active tokens)
- **Outbound transfers** — tokens sent from this wallet (sent/archived tokens)
- Both active and archived (spent) token histories are included

This ensures that all memo-referenced transfers are captured regardless of whether the underlying tokens are still in the inventory.

### 5.5 Confirmation Tracking

A transfer is `confirmed` if:
- The token involved has a full proof chain (all `TxfTransaction.inclusionProof` are non-null)
- For outbound transfers: the commitment was included in a unicity certificate
- For inbound transfers: the received token's state transitions are all proven

This is determined by checking `TokenStatus === 'confirmed'` for the related tokens in `PaymentsModule.getTokens()`.

### 5.6 Perspective Handling

The same invoice viewed by different parties:

| Party | Sees inbound transfers as | Sees outbound transfers as |
|-------|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Recipient (target address owner) | Forward payments covering invoice | Back/return payments (refunds they send) |
| Sender (payer) | Back/return payments they receive | Forward payments they sent |
| Creator (may be either) | Based on their address matching targets | Based on their outbound history |

The status computation uses the wallet's own transaction history, so each party naturally gets their perspective.

### 5.7 EXPIRED State Semantics

EXPIRED is **informational, not terminal**. When `dueDate` has passed:
- If the invoice is already CLOSED -> stays CLOSED (terminal)
- If the invoice is COVERED (all covered but not all confirmed) -> stays COVERED (will transition to CLOSED on confirmation)
- If the invoice is OPEN or PARTIAL -> becomes EXPIRED
- An EXPIRED invoice can still transition to CLOSED if all targets become covered and confirmed after expiration

This means: due date is a signal to participants, not an enforcement mechanism. The on-chain tokens don't enforce deadlines.

### 5.8 Cancellation and Closure Semantics (Local-Only)

**Cancellation and closure are strictly local.** No other party learns about them.

- **Outbound guard.** The accounting module provides a local guard: when paying out, the caller SHOULD NOT reference a locally closed or cancelled invoice. However, this guard MUST NOT block the underlying token transfer (see Section 5.9). It is advisory — the application layer decides whether to enforce it.
- **Auto-return policy.** A recipient who has cancelled an invoice may choose to auto-return incoming payments referencing it via `INV:<id>:B` return payments. This is application-level policy, not enforced by the module.
- **Perspective divergence.** Your CLOSED does not imply others' CLOSED. Different parties have different transaction histories and may compute different states for the same invoice at any given time.

### 5.9 Non-Blocking Error Guarantee

**Accounting errors MUST NEVER break the token transfer flow.**

Token transfers are atomic — they either happen fully or not at all. The accounting module is a post-hoc observer. All event processing is wrapped in try/catch:

- Memo parsing failure -> transfer proceeds, accounting ignores it
- Invoice lookup failure -> transfer proceeds, `invoice:unknown_reference` fires (best-effort)
- Status computation error -> transfer already complete, event firing skipped
- Storage failure -> transfer data persists in PaymentsModule history, accounting catches up on next recomputation

No exception from the accounting layer may propagate to or interrupt the payment layer.

## 6. Events

### 6.1 Event Definitions

All new events are added to `SphereEventType` union and `SphereEventMap` interface in `types/index.ts`.

```typescript
// New SphereEventType additions:
| 'invoice:created'
| 'invoice:payment'
| 'invoice:asset_covered'
| 'invoice:target_covered'
| 'invoice:covered'
| 'invoice:closed'
| 'invoice:cancelled'
| 'invoice:expired'
| 'invoice:unknown_reference'
| 'invoice:overpayment'
| 'invoice:irrelevant'

// New SphereEventMap entries:
'invoice:created': {
  invoiceId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;  // true once mint proof is confirmed
};

'invoice:payment': {
  invoiceId: string;
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
  direction: 'forward' | 'back';
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:asset_covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;     // target address
  coinId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:target_covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;     // target address
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:covered': {
  invoiceId: string;
  confirmed: boolean;  // false if any related token is unconfirmed
};

'invoice:closed': {
  invoiceId: string;
  // No 'confirmed' field -- CLOSED implies all confirmed
};

'invoice:cancelled': {
  invoiceId: string;
};

'invoice:expired': {
  invoiceId: string;
  // Informational only -- invoice can still transition to CLOSED
};

'invoice:unknown_reference': {
  invoiceId: string;          // referenced in memo but not in local token storage
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
};

'invoice:overpayment': {
  invoiceId: string;
  address: string;
  coinId: string;
  surplus: string;     // amount exceeding request (smallest units)
  confirmed: boolean;
};

'invoice:irrelevant': {
  invoiceId: string;
  transfer: InvoiceTransferRef;
  reason: 'unknown_address' | 'unknown_asset' | 'unknown_address_and_asset';
  confirmed: boolean;
};
```

### 6.2 Event Firing Logic

```
On PaymentsModule 'transfer:incoming' or 'history:updated':
  1. Parse memo -> get invoiceId, direction
  2. If invoiceId not in local token storage:
     -> fire 'invoice:unknown_reference' { invoiceId, transfer }
     -> return
  3. If invoice is in terminal state (CLOSED or CANCELLED):
     -> do not fire balance-related events (frozen)
     -> return
  4. Build InvoiceTransferRef from transfer data
  5. Match transfer against invoice targets:
     a. If matches target + asset:
        -> fire 'invoice:payment' { invoiceId, transfer, direction, confirmed }
     b. If doesn't match any target/asset:
        -> fire 'invoice:irrelevant' { invoiceId, transfer, reason, confirmed }
  6. Recompute status:
     a. If asset just became covered -> fire 'invoice:asset_covered'
     b. If target just became covered -> fire 'invoice:target_covered'
     c. If all targets covered:
        - If all confirmed -> fire 'invoice:closed'
        - Else -> fire 'invoice:covered' { confirmed: false }
     d. If surplus detected -> fire 'invoice:overpayment'

On PaymentsModule 'transfer:confirmed':
  1. Check if transfer has invoice memo reference
  2. If invoice is in terminal state -> skip
  3. If yes, recompute and re-fire all applicable events with confirmed: true
  4. If all targets covered AND now all confirmed -> fire 'invoice:closed'

On createInvoice() or importInvoice():
  1. Store the invoice token
  2. Scan FULL transaction history for transfers referencing this invoice
  3. For each matching transfer found: fire events as if the transfer just arrived
     (invoice:payment, invoice:asset_covered, invoice:target_covered, etc.)
  4. This handles the P2P async case where payments arrive before the invoice
```

### 6.3 Idempotency Contract

**Events may fire multiple times.** The AccountingModule does NOT track which events have been fired. On every relevant trigger (incoming transfer, confirmation, history update, invoice creation/import with retroactive scan), it recomputes from scratch and fires all applicable events.

This means consumers WILL receive duplicate events and MUST handle them idempotently:
- A UI should update its display, not append to a list
- A notification system should deduplicate by (invoiceId, event type, transferId)
- A logging system can safely log duplicates

This design is intentional -- it avoids complex "already-fired" bookkeeping and aligns with the Nostr re-delivery model used elsewhere in the SDK.

### 6.4 Due Date Expiration

The `invoice:expired` event fires when `getInvoiceStatus()` or event recomputation detects that `dueDate` has passed and the invoice is in OPEN or PARTIAL state. Since events are idempotent, this may fire multiple times. Consumers should treat it as informational.

---

## 7. Storage

### 7.1 Token Storage (Primary)

Invoice tokens are stored via `TokenStorageProvider` -- the **same** provider used for currency tokens, nametag tokens, etc. The token's `genesis.data.tokenType` of `INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX` identifies it as an invoice.

On `load()`, the AccountingModule filters all tokens in storage by token type to discover invoice tokens. All invoice data (terms, creator, targets, etc.) is read from the token's `genesis.data.tokenData` field.

### 7.2 Cancellation Storage

Since cancellation is local-only (not encoded in the token), a minimal per-address key tracks cancelled invoice IDs:

Added to `STORAGE_KEYS_ADDRESS` in `constants.ts`:

```typescript
/** Cancelled invoice IDs (JSON string array) */
CANCELLED_INVOICES: 'cancelled_invoices',
```

Full key format: `sphere_{addressId}_cancelled_invoices`

Storage schema:

```typescript
// Simple array of cancelled invoice token IDs
type CancelledInvoicesStorage = string[];
```

### 7.3 Storage Operations

```
createInvoice():
  1. tokenStorage.saveToken(invoiceToken)       // TXF token with InvoiceTerms in tokenData
  2. Scan full history for pre-existing payments // retroactive evaluation
  3. Fire events                                 // created + any retroactive events

importInvoice():
  1. tokenStorage.saveToken(invoiceToken)       // same as any received token
  2. Scan full history for pre-existing payments // retroactive evaluation
  3. Fire events                                 // any retroactive events

cancelInvoice():
  1. Load cancelled set from storage
  2. Add invoiceId to set
  3. storage.set(CANCELLED_INVOICES_KEY, updatedSet)

getInvoiceStatus():
  1. Read token from tokenStorage (parse terms from genesis.data.tokenData)
  2. Read cancelled set from storage
  3. If terminal (cancelled or closed) -> return frozen status
  4. Read full history from PaymentsModule (active + sent tokens)
  5. Compute status (pure function, no writes)

load():
  1. Enumerate tokens from tokenStorage
  2. Filter by tokenType === INVOICE_TOKEN_TYPE_HEX
  3. Parse InvoiceTerms from each token's genesis.data.tokenData
  4. Load cancelled set from storage
  5. Subscribe to PaymentsModule events
  6. Scan full history for pre-existing payments -> fire retroactive events
```

```

## Appendix C: Exchange/Swap Scenario

```
Exchange creates invoice:
  Target 1: exchange_address <- Buyer sends 100 USDU  [coin: ["USDU", "100000000"]]
  Target 2: buyer_address    <- Exchange sends 50 TKN  [coin: ["TKN", "50000000"]]

Both parties hold the invoice token.

Buyer sends 100 USDU -> memo: INV:xxx:F
  -> Exchange sees: target[0] COVERED (from their inbound history)
  -> Buyer sees: target[0] payment sent (from their outbound history)

Exchange sends 50 TKN -> memo: INV:xxx:F
  -> Buyer sees: target[1] COVERED (from their inbound history)
  -> Exchange sees: target[1] payment sent (from their outbound history)

Both parties independently compute COVERED -> CLOSED.
Balances frozen after CLOSED.
```

## Appendix D: P2P Async -- Payment Before Invoice

```
Time 1: Payer sends 500 USDU with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Recipient receives transfer
        -> AccountingModule fires invoice:unknown_reference (abc not yet known)
        -> Transfer recorded in history

Time 2: Recipient creates/imports invoice token abc
        -> AccountingModule performs full history rescan
        -> Finds the Time 1 transfer with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Fires invoice:payment for 500 USDU (retroactive)
        -> If 500 USDU covers the target:asset, fires invoice:asset_covered
        -> Continues with normal event cascade

This works because all events are idempotent.
```

## Appendix E: Token Spending Independence

```
Time 1: Alice receives 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 500

Time 2: Alice spends the 500 UCT token to buy something (memo: "Coffee")
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 500 (UNCHANGED)
        -> The outbound transfer has no INV:abc memo, so it doesn't affect the invoice
        -> The 500 UCT token is archived, but its INBOUND history entry still exists

Time 3: Alice receives another 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 1000

Time 4: Alice sends 200 UCT back with memo INV:abc:B
        -> Invoice abc: target[alice] UCT covered = 1000, returned = 200, net = 800
```

## Appendix F: Multi-Asset Token Transfer

```
Invoice abc:
  Target: DIRECT://alice
    - coin: ["UCT", "1000"]
    - coin: ["USDU", "500"]

Time 1: Payer sends a MULTI-ASSET token with
        coinData = [["UCT", "600"], ["USDU", "500"]]
        memo: INV:abc:F
        destination: DIRECT://alice

        -> AccountingModule extracts both coin entries:
           - InvoiceTransferRef { transferId: "tx1", coinId: "UCT", amount: "600" }
           - InvoiceTransferRef { transferId: "tx1", coinId: "USDU", amount: "500" }
        -> UCT: coveredAmount = 600, net = 600 (needs 1000 -- not yet covered)
        -> USDU: coveredAmount = 500, net = 500 (needs 500 -- COVERED)
        -> Fires: invoice:payment (x2, one per coin)
        -> Fires: invoice:asset_covered for USDU
        -> State: PARTIAL (UCT still uncovered)

Time 2: Payer sends another token with coinData = [["UCT", "400"]]
        memo: INV:abc:F
        -> UCT: coveredAmount = 1000, net = 1000 -- COVERED
        -> Fires: invoice:asset_covered for UCT
        -> Fires: invoice:target_covered for alice
        -> Fires: invoice:covered
        -> ... all confirmed -> invoice:closed
```

## Appendix G: Local Cancellation Behavior

```
Recipient cancels invoice abc locally:
  -> Fires invoice:cancelled
  -> Balances frozen (locally)
  -> Sender does NOT know about cancellation

Sender sends 500 UCT with memo INV:abc:F (unaware of cancellation):
  -> Token transfer succeeds (accounting NEVER blocks transfers)
  -> Recipient's AccountingModule sees the transfer
  -> Invoice is CANCELLED locally -> no balance update, no coverage events
  -> Transfer is visible via getRelatedTransfers() but status stays CANCELLED

Recipient application-level policy (optional):
